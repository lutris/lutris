Fixed this session:
- #6109 (Battle.net missing titles)
- #6280 (Gamescope not killed)
- #6267 (XFCE screensaver)

Client-fixable issues remaining:
- #6229 - Steam source hiding (needs filter logic fix)
- #6000 - Winetricks with UMU (needs to handle --gui differently)
- #6231 - Ubisoft pictures (may need fallback for missing thumbImage)
