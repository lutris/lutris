        ### Important notice
        **This repository is not a place for requesting support with a game, runner or an installer.**
        *If you have issues installing a game or launching it*, make sure you follow our essential guides on [graphics driver installation](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md) and [dependencies for the wine runner](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/WineDependencies.md).
        *If you followed the guides and the issues persist*, try asking for help in our official [Lutris Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/Pnt5CuY).
        *If you think there is a legitimate issue with our Lutris Wine builds*, open an issue in our [Lutris Wine repository](https://github.com/lutris/wine) instead.
        *If you think Lutris is missing an important feature*, try opening a *Feature Request* instead.
