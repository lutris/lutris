# This profile allows almost everything and only exists to allow
# bwrap to work on a system with user namespace restrictions
# being enforced.
# bwrap is allowed access to user namespaces and capabilities
# within the user namespace, but its children do not have
# capabilities, blocking bwrap from being able to be used to
# arbitrarily by-pass the user namespace restrictions.
#
# Note: the bwrap child is stacked against the bwrap profile due to
# bwraps use of no-new-privs

# disabled by default as it can break some use cases on a system that
# doesn't have or has disable user namespace restrictions for unconfined
# use aa-enforce to enable it
