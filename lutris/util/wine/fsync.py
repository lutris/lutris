"""Module for detecting the availability of the Linux futex
FUTEX_WAIT_MULTIPLE operation, or the Linux futex2 syscalls.

Either of these is required for fsync to work in Wine. Fsync is an
alternative implementation of the Windows synchronization primitives
that are used to guard data from being accessed by multiple threads
concurrently (which would be A Bad Thingâ„¢).

Fsync improves upon the previous implementation in Wine of these
primitives, known as esync, which in turn improved upon the original
implementation known as "Server-side synchronization".

The original implementation used a wineserver call for each
synchronization operation, which required multiple context switches per
operation.

Esync instead used file descriptors for synchronization, which can be
passed around between processes and therefore allowed synchronization
to happen directly between the processes involved, instead of going
through the wineserver. This made the synchronization operations
faster and improved performance of games a bit.
A problem with this implementation was that each created synchronization
object required one file descriptor, and there is only a limited amount
of these available for each process. Some games would run out of
available file descriptors, and would stop working. This has been partly
mitigated by raising the per-process file descriptor limit, but there
are also games that leak synchronization objects continuously while
running, and would eventually run out despite the raised limits.

Fsync improved on esync by not requiring a file descriptor for each
created synchronization object, and instead using the Linux kernel's
futex interface for synchronizations. This matches Windows's
implementation more closely and mitigated all the file descriptor
related issues of esync. However, since the default futex interface was
insufficient for implementing all required synchronization operations,
a patch to the Linux kernel was needed, which usually meant that users
needed to compile their own Linux kernel with the patch, or install a
kernel provided by a third-party. It was attempted to get the kernel
patch into the mainline Linux kernel, but it didn't get accepted.

Instead, patches were written that would add a new set of system calls
which extend the original futex system calls, dubbed "futex2", and the
Wine fsync code was adjusted to make use of these new system calls.
The new Wine fsync code is backwards-compatible with the old futex
patch, therefore it makes sense for now to detect the presence of
either patch in the running kernel. The detection of the old patch
can probably be removed when the new patch is merged and in a stable
Linux release.

This module's code is based on https://gist.github.com/openglfreak/715d5ab5902497378f1996061dbbf8ec
